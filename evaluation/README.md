These are the simulated OCELs which were evaluated for the paper "Discovering Object-Centric Process Simulation Models".

The event attribute "STEPS" indicate at which step in the simulation run the event happened. This is to facilitate analyses of the course of the process.

Subfolder *om* contains simulated logs (OCELs). Subfolder *p2p* contains JSON files describing only the generated objects. As described in the paper, p2p was not evaluated for behavior.
